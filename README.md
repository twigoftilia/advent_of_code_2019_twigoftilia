# Advent of Code 2019

[Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019)

Still trying to learn rust, so why not take on some of the Advent of code 2019 challenges :)
Busy busy, so the ambition is moderate. Mostly weekends... 
Warning - you should probably - no... definitively - look at other peoples code for best practice idiomatic rust.

## Goals

Personal goal and rules (so very different from my "real" coding):
 
  * use rust
  * finish say 15/50 (firsts and or seconds) puzzles (2018 goal was 20 10x2)
  * Peak at forums at will (changed since 2018, was: no peaking at AoC threads)
  * challenge myself to leave code that I know could be done better and to actually code over researching algorithms
  * bad and ugly is fine, just get done with it
  * 2019 ignore 2018 rule "implement simple algorithms over use crates or snippets"
  * ignore rules at will

## How to run

Until further notice, 

    cargo run --release

will run all puzzles done. 

## Status

Personal goal: 15 stars (of max 50)
current: 8
